# Implementation of the GCBM in Colombia
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

GCBM implementation in Colombia, initially with a focus on DOM modelling.

This project is based on the Standalone Template for the GCBM, downloaded from https://carbon.nfis.org/cbm

**Disclaimer:** The calculations performed in this repository are not official and do not represent the Government of Colombia in any way.

## Installation instructions

1. Clone the repository

2. Download the installation tools from "releases" (https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Colombia/releases/tag/install_tools) and unzip them into Standalone_GCBM/tools folder

The installation instuctions are located in Standalone_GCBM/readme.txt

## Custom configuration

This implementation of the GCBM includes several parameter changes, that were included to adapt the model to ColombiaÂ´s local conditions

the Standalone_GCBM/run_all.bat file includes all the steps that were taken to adapt the model, as default, all parameter changes are enabled.

1. A custom Generic Tropical species in created (input_database\add_species_vol_to_bio.py) using a linear volume to biomass conversion factor and proportions of stem, bark, foliage and branges extracted from local literature. 

2. A custom set of root parameters (to convert from AGB to BGB) is applied (input_database\modify_root_parameters.py)

3. A set of decay parameters that was compiled from the scientific literature (input_database\custom_parameters\decay parameters.py) and is used to mofidy the default ones (input_database\modify_decay_parameters.py)

4. A sensitive turnover parameter (tree mortality) was modified (input_database\modify_turnover_parameters.py)

5. The disturbance regime of the spinup procedure was changed to "Clear-cut with slash-burn" every 15 years (input_database\modify_spinup_parameters.py) to refect the historic deforestation of tropical areas in Colombia, for agricultural purposes.

Steps 3, 4 and 5 can be enabled/disabled in the run_all.bat file to perform a sensitivity analysis
