## Technology Stack

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)


## Installation and usage instructions on Windows

1. Clone the repository

2. Download the installation tools from "releases" (https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Colombia/releases/tag/install_tools) and unzip them into `Standalone_GCBM\tools` folder

3. Follow the installation instructions, located in `Standalone_GCBM\README.md`

4. Modify the `Standalone_GCBM\run_all.bat` file to activate or deactivate the custom parameter modifications (explained below), as default, all custom configurations are enabled

4. Execute `run_all.bat`

This codebase was tested using a Windows 10 system, the `Standalone_GCBM\README.md` file contains further explanation on the GCBM usage, and tutorials on the model can be found in the moja.global [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQUrrNP1Xf-Fv4c8uHYXhQ)

## Custom configuration for Colombia

This implementation of the GCBM includes several parameter changes, that were included to adapt the model to ColombiaÂ´s local conditions

The `Standalone_GCBM\run_all.bat` file includes all the steps that were taken to adapt the model, as default, all parameter changes are enabled.

1. A custom Generic Tropical species in created (`input_database\add_species_vol_to_bio.py`) using a linear volume to biomass conversion factor and proportions of stem, bark, foliage and branges extracted from local literature. 

2. A custom set of root parameters (to convert from AGB to BGB) is applied (`input_database\modify_root_parameters.py`)

3. A set of decay parameters that was compiled from the scientific literature (`input_database\custom_parameters\decay parameters.py`) and is used to mofidy the default ones (`input_database\modify_decay_parameters.py`)

4. A sensitive turnover parameter (tree mortality) was modified (`input_database\modify_turnover_parameters.py`)

5. The disturbance regime of the spinup procedure was changed to "Clear-cut with slash-burn" every 15 years (`input_database\modify_spinup_parameters.py`) to refect the historic deforestation of tropical areas in Colombia, for agricultural purposes.

Steps 3, 4 and 5 can be enabled/disabled in the `run_all.bat` file to perform a sensitivity analysis

## Docker-based setup

1. Clone the `docker-setup` branch of [GCBM.Colombia](https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Colombia) using the command

      ```git clone -b docker-setup https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Colombia```

2. Navigate into `GCBM.Colombia` 

      ```cd GCBM.Colombia```

3. Use docker-compose to build the image

      ```docker-compose up -d```

4. Run the container using the command

      ``` docker exec -it gcbm-colombia /bin/bash ```

5. Inside the running docker container, run 

      ```cd /server/gcbm_project```

6. Start the simulation using 

    ```/opt/gcbm/moja.cli --config_file gcbm_config.cfg --config_provider provider_config.json``` 

If there are existing images cached on your machine you may need to `docker pull ghcr.io/moja-global/rest_api_gcbm:master` and build the container using `docker-compose -d --force-recreate`
